# About this Project
This is a personal Project of mine. It is not really intended for Public use (yet (maybe)). There is no guarantee that any of this is working or good.


# Inspiration
When writing this code I took inspiration from the following sources
- dwm: Because i have previously hacked on dwm some parts of the code are very "similar" to parts in dwm. Especially with low level X11 stuff that i didn't want to figure out myself
- herbstluftwm: I have also consulted the source code of herbstluftwm from time to time

# TODO:
- [ ] Implement Mouse Support
- [ ] Implement Command Line Arguments
- [ ] Implement Autostart
- [ ] Implement Bar Toggling
- [ ] Test Current Version
- [ ] Complete Nix config options
